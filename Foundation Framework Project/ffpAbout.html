			<h1>About Maureen's Children</h1>
			<p>Maureen Laurel Descouteaux was born in 1941 in Boston, Massachusetts to Dr. Seth Anderson and Charlotte Descouteaux. While her parents were not magically inclined, making Maureen a <a href="ffpGlossary.html#lavenderChild">lavender child</a>, they were advocates for the witch community. Naturally, Maureen herself grew into an outspoken representative for witches everywhere, using her talents in public speaking to lead marches, protests, and meetings all over the country. </p>
			
			<p>1999 brought the darkest days of witches everywhere: <a href="ffpGlossary.html#dos">The Days of Salem</a>, when the town of Salem, Oregon was cleared of all <a href="ffpGlossary.html#green">green men and women</a> to create a contained area for the North American witch population. Supposedly a safe haven for the magically inclined, Salem turned out to be, in fact, a government experimentation camp. From October 1999 to March 2004 thousands of witches were tortured and killed by green scientists in a fruitless effort to discover the secrets of magic. During this time, Maureen Descouteaux sought to bring the community together to raise spirits. These men, women, and children thought of Maureen as a spiritual mother and became the first of Maureen’s Children.</p>
			
			<p>While little could be done to prevent the horrors of Salem, Mother Maureen’s group expressed their emotions through arts, crafts, and stories, giving aid to their peers, and (perhaps most impactful of all) stepping into the torture chambers of green scientists to preserve the lives of their loved ones.</p>
			
			<p>When Salem was finally overrun successfully by <a href="ffpGlossary.html#sados">The Sons and Daughters of Salem</a>, Maureen’s Children stayed together and tried to spread the message of tolerance for the witch community under Maureen’s leadership. Hundreds of protests and marches and meetings were held with the group in attendance, leading to what little progress was made in the national community at large.</p>
			
			<p>On March 21st, 2068 at the age of 127, Mother Maureen Laurel Descouteaux passed away peacefully in her sleep. Her memorial service was attended by well-over 2,000 witches and green men and women, all who considered her, to some degree or another, a mother. March 21st is now known as <a href="ffpGlossary.html#mmd">Mother Maureen’s Day</a> in honor of this strong, passionate, courageous woman.</p>
			
			<p>Today, Maureen’s Children still reaches out to the national community, striving to gain major civil rights for witches everywhere. The group also brings in young witches and gives them guidance and teaching in the magical arts, giving many a home who would otherwise not have one. </p>
